Predicting Heart Disease using personal key indicators with the help of Machine Learning || Brac University || CSE422 : Artificial Intelligence

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting heart disease using personal key indicators. The dataset, containing a mix of categorical and continuous features, is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets. Multiple machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, SVM, and Naive Bayes, are employed to predict heart disease risk. Among these, Logistic Regression demonstrates the highest accuracy at 91.57%, highlighting its effectiveness in this context. The project further explores avenues for improvement, such as advanced feature selection, the use of ensemble methods, hyperparameter tuning, and validation on larger datasets. Ultimately, this work lays the foundation for more accurate and reliable heart disease predictions, with the potential for real-world clinical applications and enhanced patient care.
